	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study is to develop a method to reliably characterize multiple features of the corticospinal system in a more efficient manner than typically done in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies.

Methods
Forty TMS pulses of varying intensity were given over the first dorsal interosseous motor hot spot in 10 healthy adults. The FDI motor evoked potential (MEP) size was recorded during rest and activation to create recruitment curves. The Boltzmann sigmoidal function was fit to the data, and parameters relating to maximal MEP size, curve slope, and stimulus intensity leading to half-maximal MEP size were computed from the curve fit.

Results
Good to excellent test-retest reliability was found for all corticospinal parameters at rest and during activation with 40 TMS pulses.

Conclusions
Through the use of curve fitting, important features of the corticospinal system can be determined with fewer stimuli than typically used for the same information. Determining the recruitment curve provides a basis to understand the state of the corticospinal system and select subject-specific parameters for TMS testing quickly and without unnecessary exposure to magnetic stimulation. This method can be useful in individuals who have difficulty maintaining stillness, including children and patients with motor disorders.},

	abstract = {The recruitment curves of the monosynaptic Hoffmann (H) reflex and of the direct motor (M) excitation of alpha-motor fibers of the posterior popliteal nerve were studied in seven human subjects in normoxic and hypoxic conditions at sea level. The amplitude of the H and M responses were determined from the computerized full-wave rectified and integrated surface electromyographic (EMG) signal derived from bipolar surface electrodes placed over the soleus muscle. Hypoxic exposure [end-tidal O2 fraction (FETO2) = 0.066 +/- 0.003 and end-tidal CO2 fraction (FETCO2) = 0.0504 +/- 0.001 (SE)] did not affect the maximal M (Mmax) response but decreased significantly (7\%) the maximal H (Hmax) response. The Hmax/Mmax ratio decreased from 0.60 to 0.53. Furthermore, by fitting the rising phase of the recruitment curves of the H and M responses vs. stimulus intensity with linear regressions, hypoxia was found to produce a significant decrease of similar magnitude (6\%) in the threshold of both the H and M responses with no change in slope. Using a constant stimulus strength eliciting an H response of half the maximum (H50\%) of the control conditions, hypoxia resulted in a 50\% increase in the amplitude of the H response within 12 min. These results suggest that the effects of hypoxia on the nervous system consist of a direct depolarizing action on the peripheral alpha-fibers and 1A sensory fibers and of a central effect on supraspinal structures affecting the spinal alpha-motoneurons.},

	abstract = {Over half of all spinal cord injuries (SCIs) are cervical, which can lead to paralysis and respiratory compromise, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Effective treatments to restore breathing after severe upper cervical injury are lacking; thus, it is imperative to develop therapies to address this. Epidural stimulation has successfully restored motor function after SCI for stepping, standing, reaching, grasping, and postural control. We hypothesized that closed-loop stimulation triggered via healthy hemidiaphragm EMG activity has the potential to elicit functional neuroplasticity in spinal respiratory pathways after cervical SCI (cSCI). To test this, we delivered closed-loop, electrical, epidural stimulation (CLES) at the level of the phrenic motor nucleus (C4) for 3 d after C2 hemisection (C2HS) in freely behaving rats. A 2 × 2 Latin Square experimental design incorporated two treatments, C2HS injury and CLES therapy resulting in four groups of adult, female Sprague Dawley rats: C2HS + CLES (n = 8), C2HS (n = 6), intact + CLES (n = 6), intact (n = 6). In stimulated groups, CLES was delivered for 12–20 h/d for 3 d. After C2HS, 3 d of CLES robustly facilitated the slope of stimulus-response curves of ipsilesional spinal motor evoked potentials (sMEPs) versus nonstimulated controls. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of CLES eliciting respiratory neuroplasticity after C2HS in freely behaving animals. These findings suggest CLES as a promising future therapy to address respiratory deficiency associated with cSCI.},

	abstract = {Experiments were done to determine the form of the input-output relation (i.e. stimulus intensity vs response amplitude) of the corticospinal pathway of the first dorsal interosseous and the tibialis anterior, respectively. Our purpose was to determine from these quantitative relations which input-output parameters would be useful measures in studies dealing with motor cortical task dependence. The motor cortex was excited by focal transcranial magnetic stimuli and the evoked motor response were recorded with surface electromyographic electrodes. In some experiments the discharge probability of single motor units in response to magnetic stimuli of increasing intensity was determined from intramuscular recordings. For both muscles the form of the input-output relation was sigmoidal. The steepness of the relation increased, up to 4–7 times the value at rest, with increasing tonic background activity. The threshold decreased, but only slightly, with increasing tonic background activity. The minimum value of the threshold was reached at activation levels of about 10–20\% of the maximum tonic effort, whereas the steepness of the relation reached its maximum at higher activation levels, typically about 30–40\% of the maximum tonic effort. These observations imply that these two input-output parameters of the corticospinal pathway – one reflecting the bias level (threshold) and the other the gain (slope) – are determined by different neural mechanisms. The plateau level of the sigmoidal input-output relation was not influenced by the background activation level, except that in some subjects (4/9) it could not be reached when no background motor activity was present. This was probably due, for the most part, to limitation of the maximum stimulator output. Additionally, this finding may reflect a change in the intrinsic excitability of the motor cortex in going from rest to activity, or that convergent inputs from different descending and afferent systems are required for maximal activation of motoneuron pools. Thus, the threshold, steepness and plateau level characterize the input-output parameters of the human corticospinal pathway for a given level of motor activity. In contrast to the nonlinear input-output relation of the corticospinal pathway as whole, which includes the motoneuron pool and any spinal interneuronal relays, the discharge probability of all single motor units was a linearly increasing function of the stimulus strength (r≥0.9, P{\textless}0.01). Thus, the sigmoidal input-output relation of the corticospinal pathway, as a whole, is not due to the input-output properties of single motoneurons. The possible neural mechanisms which underlie the shape and parameters of the input-output relation as well as the methodological implications of the results are considered.},

	abstract = {Stimulus-response curves for motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced in a hand muscle by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were constructed for 42 subjects with the aim of identifying differences related to age and sex. There was no effect of age on the resting threshold to TMS, the maximal amplitude of the MEP that could be evoked (MEPmax) or the maximal slope of the stimulus-response curve. However, higher stimulus intensities were required to achieve both MEPmax and the maximal slope in the older subjects. The trial-to-trial variability of MEPs was greater in the older subjects, particularly at intensities near threshold. There was a significant interaction between age, threshold and trial-to-trial variability of MEP amplitude. Overall, MEP variability fell markedly as stimulus intensity increased above threshold but less rapidly in older than in younger subjects. Females tended to have larger MEP variability than males, but age and threshold were much stronger modulators than sex. These differences in input-output characteristics are likely to be due either to a decreased number of spinal motoneurones being activated synchronously in older subjects, or to the activation of the same number of motoneurones in a less synchronous manner, leading to phase cancellation in the surface electromyogram.},

	abstract = {In classical statistics, the significance of comparisons (e.g., θ1− θ2) is calibrated using the Type 1 error rate, relying on the assumption that the true difference is zero, which makes no sense in many applications. We set up a more relevant framework in which a true comparison can be positive or negative, and, based on the data, you can state “θ1 {\textgreater} θ2 with confidence,” “θ2 {\textgreater} θ1 with confidence,” or “no claim with confidence.” We focus on the Type S (for sign) error, which occurs when you claim “θ1 {\textgreater} θ2 with confidence” when θ2{\textgreater} θ1 (or vice-versa). We compute the Type S error rates for classical and Bayesian confidence statements and find that classical Type S error rates can be extremely high (up to 50\%). Bayesian confidence statements are conservative, in the sense that claims based on 95\% posterior intervals have Type S error rates between 0 and 2.5\%. For multiple comparison situations, the conclusions are similar.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},
